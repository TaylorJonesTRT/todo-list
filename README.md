# ToDO

[Live Demo!](https://taylorjonestrt.github.io/todo-list/)



## What is it?

With ToDO you can create different projects which inside of those you can create many different items (tasks) and set those task's descriptions, due dates and even their priorities (High, Medium, Low) so that you can keep better track of your daily tasks or even a honey to do list!

ToDO uses your browsers localStorage to store all of your Projects and Items inside of said projects.



## But why?

ToDO is a personal project that was created for the purpose of learning how to code using OOP rather than procedural while also incorporating past knowledge gained from other projects while learning how to write in Javascript (npm, webpack, ES6 Classes). 



## What does it use?

Vanilla Javascript

HTML/CSS

NPM (npx webpack and in the future date-fns to better format the due dates for items)
